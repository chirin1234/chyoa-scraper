### CHYOA Scraper
Currently [CHYOA](https://chyoa.com) has no way of exporting stories. This project's goal is to fix that. Hopefully the format it outputs is sane enough for other people to write their own formats if they wish.

#### Usage
This program uses Python 3. You can either import it as a library, or run it from the command line:

`python -m chyoa chyoa-story-url [destination-path]`

By default the program stores the exported story in the current directory.

#### License
Available under the terms of the MIT license. See `LICENSE`.
