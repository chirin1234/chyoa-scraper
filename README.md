### CHYOA Scraper
Currently [CHYOA](https://chyoa.com) has no way of exporting stories. This project's goal is to fix that, and by fix that I mean hack together a program that can mostly do its job.

#### Usage
This program uses Python 3. You can either import it as a library, or run it from the command line:

`python -m chyoa [chyoa-story-url]`

#### License
Available under the terms of the MIT license. See `LICENSE`.
